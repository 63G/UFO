# UFO
 a guessing game where a player needs to guess a codeword that will save his friend from abduction


HOW TO PLAY:

run the game, then you will be able to guess a character from the codeword and update the answer.
if the guess is incorrect, a misses counter will increase and also we will display the wrong character for you. if you guessed right, the current answer will be updated to show what position the correct guess can be found.

if you reached the maximum limit of misses, then your friend is abducted and game is over. However, if you get the correct codeword, you have saved your friend!
